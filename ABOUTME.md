# Why am I here

* I am in this course because I want to master the use of Python for the purpose of helping my fellow Data Engineers and Data Scientists in their ETL and Data Science projects.

# What will I do after the bootcamp?

* Probably, one year after the bootcamp I would like to dedicate my efforts to an industry where my expertise is put to generate a positive social effect.
* My ideal future role is to lead a team of analysts, data engineers and data scientists towards the goal of a positive social effect. I need to find the company that suits to that and is in the need of such profile.
